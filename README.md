COMP30022 IT Project Tuesday 12PM - Group 11
Provision IT 
## Background:
All tradespeople that attend a property for maintenance across a range of specialisations require
some prior knowledge in order to carry out their work. For example, what paint colour and type was
used or where are the electrical or plumbing feeds coming from the street. In order to complete
maintenance works this information can save a trade a lot of time in preparation for a job on
premises.
## Aim:
Create a database to store property information with a mobile application (*multi platform) for
view/edit/update access. Note that this will be split into two teams using a common schema – one
for the administration and property owner admin portal and one for the tradesperson interface to
use a QR code with a pin to access a property for view/edit/update.
## Admin / Owner Web Portal:
- Onboarding for property owners / developers in order to set the foundations of a
property including plans, utility and fitting data and ability to set/change property PIN/access
token to share access with
- Admin functions to allow property transfer and scrutinise all adds/edits/updates
- Export and reporting capability for a property owner – e.g. PDF extraction of all data
including images
